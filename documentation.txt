Timeframes:

They are composed of the multiplier and the timeframe unit, e.g., “1S”, “30” (30 minutes), “1D” (one day), “3M” (three months).
The unit is represented by a single letter, with no letter used for minutes: “T” for ticks, “S” for seconds, “D” for days, “W” for weeks, and “M” for months.

To retrieve the alert timeframe, the timeframe.period variable can be used in pinescript.

For the dashboard, we only need 6 timeframes:
- 5 minute: The alert should contain '5'
- 15 minute: The alert should contain '15'
- 1 hour: The alert should contain '60'. There is no “hour” unit; “1H” is not valid. The correct format for one hour is “60”
- 4 hour: The alert should contain '240'
- 1 day: The alert should contain 'D'
- 1 week: The alert should contain 'W'

INSTALLATION:
To install it locally, you must have a web server with PHP and MYSQL. 
The "alertdashboard.sql" file at the root contains instructions to create the database, which you can import into phpMyAdmin after creating the database "alertdashboard"
The Database connection configuration file is set in Models/Core/mysqlconnection.php file and in Models/Core/Manager.php on line 12. 

About the source code:
I used a Model/View/Controller framework coded from scratch. This ensures the code to be optimised and easy to work with.
